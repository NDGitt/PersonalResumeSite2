## App Overview and Objectives

Create a single-page personal resume website for an individual named Haas. The site will serve as an online CV that highlights key personal and professional information, presented in a creative and visually engaging format.

## Target Audience

Potential employers, collaborators, or anyone interested in Haas's background and experience.

## Core Features and Functionality

* Intro/Bio section with a short personal summary.
* Contact information (email and personal website displayed).
* Profile photo (placeholder initially).
* Education history section.
* Work experience section.
* Social media links (placeholders).
* Smooth scrolling between sections.
* Subtle animations and hover effects for visual appeal.

## High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Animations**: CSS transitions or a lightweight JavaScript animation library (e.g., AOS or GSAP)
* **Deployment**: Replit (suitable for static site hosting)

## Conceptual Data Model

No backend or dynamic content — all data will be hardcoded in the HTML or a separate JS/JSON file if desired.

## User Interface Design Principles

* Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
* Creative and colorful theme with modern typography.
* Clear section separations with smooth scrolling.
* Use of animations to enhance, not overwhelm, the content.

## Security Considerations

* Displayed email may be harvested by bots — consider obfuscation (e.g., replacing "@" with "\[at]") if spam becomes an issue.
* No user authentication required.

## Development Phases or Milestones

1. Set up basic HTML structure with placeholder content.
2. Apply creative, colorful CSS styling and responsive layout.
3. Add animations and interactive effects.
4. Test across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
5. Deploy on Replit.

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

* **Responsive layout tuning**: Use media queries and flexible units.
* **Design cohesion**: Choose a defined color palette and stick to it.
* **Overuse of animations**: Keep effects subtle and purposeful.

## Future Expansion Possibilities

* Add a downloadable resume link (PDF).
* Integrate a simple blog or portfolio section.
* Include dark mode or theme toggle.
* Add localization for multiple languages if needed.
